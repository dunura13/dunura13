# Hi, i'm Dunura

i'm a 2nd year computer engineering student at the University of Toronto, currently working as a Machine Learning Software Engineer at **UTMIST**, where i engineer automated pipelines and fine-tune transformer models

i’m also a software developer at **utesca**, building crowd simulation architectures in c# and unity, and a firmware developer at **NeurotechUofT**, working on data collection for bci interactions. i love building systems that bridge the gap between hardware, ai, and full-stack web apps.
