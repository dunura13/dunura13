# Hi, i'm dunura

[cite_start]i'm a 2nd year computer engineering student at the University of Toronto [cite: 4, 5, 7][cite_start], currently working as a Machine Learning Software Engineer at **UTMIST**, where i engineer automated pipelines and fine-tune transformer models[cite: 15, 16, 19, 21]

[cite_start]i’m also an ml software engineer at **utmist**, engineering automated data pipelines and fine-tuning transformer models [cite: 15, 16, 19, 21][cite_start], and a firmware developer at **neurotechuoft**, working on data collection for bci interactions[cite: 24, 25, 28]. i love building systems that bridge the gap between hardware, ai, and full-stack web apps.
